# Introduction

## What is Azure Cache for Redis?

[Azure Cache for Redis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) is Microsoftâ€™s in-memory data store in Azure technology stack. Azure Cache for Redis improves the performance of an application that rely on large data stores. Key purpose of the Azure Cache for Redis is able to process mass amount of request by storing frequently requested data in the server that can be written to and read from  rapidly. Redis allow a low-latency and high-throughput data storage solution to modern applications. Azure Cache for Redis is created to manage Cache instances.


## Key Features of Azure Cache for Redis

* Azure Cache for Redis offers both the Redis open-source and a commercial product from Redis Labs as a managed service.
* Automatic updates and patching (Patch can be Scheduled).
* Capacity management with automatic scaling options in terms of Service tiers (Basic, Standard, Premium).

 ## Connector Overview
 
 Azure Cache for Redis Ballerina connector is a connector for managing to Azure Cache for
 Redis via Ballerina language easily. It provides capability to perform operations related to managing redis cache like Create, Read, Update and delete Azure cache instances, firewall rules, patch schedules and private endpoint connections. This connector promotes easy integration and access to Azure Cache for Redis via ballerina by handling most of the burden on ballerina developers in configuring a new connection to the Azure Cache for Redis from scratch.

 Ballerina Azure Cache for Redis connector provides support for all the operations for 
 management of Azure Cache Instances and where used extensively by the existing developer 
 community. For version 0.1.0 of this connector, version 2020-06-01 of Azure Cache for Redis REST API is used.

# Quickstart(s)

# Configuration
Instantiate the connector by giving authorization credentials that a client application can use.

## Getting the authorization credentials
Have to register an application in azure Active Directory and generate Client Id and Client Secret for that application in Active Directory.

## Azure Cache for Redis Management Client

There is only one client provided by Ballerina to interact with Azure Cache for Redis

**azure_cache_redis:Client** - This creates a Azure Cache for Redis Client instance and perform different actions related to creating managing that Azure cache Instance, Firewall Rules, Patch Schedules and Linked Servers.

```ballerina
azure_cache_redis:AzureRedisConfiguration config = {oauth2Config: {
        tokenUrl: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/" + <TENANT_ID> + "/oauth2/v2.0/token",
        clientId: <CLIENT_ID>,
        clientSecret: <CLIENT_SECRET>,
        scopes: ["https://management.azure.com/.default"]
}};
Client azureRedisManagementClient = new (config);
```

# Sample
First, import the `ballerinax/azure_cache_redis` module into the Ballerina project.
```ballerina
import ballerinax/azure_cache_redis;
```

You can now make the connection configuration using the connection string and entity path.
```ballerina
azure_cache_redis:AzureRedisConfiguration config = {oauth2Config: {
        tokenUrl: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/" + config:getAsString("TENANT_ID") + "/oauth2/v2.0/token",
        clientId: config:getAsString("CLIENT_ID"),
        clientSecret: config:getAsString("CLIENT_SECRET"),
        scopes: ["https://management.azure.com/.default"]
}};
Client azureRedisManagementClient = new (config);
```

### Create Azure Cache Instance

This part describes how to use the ballerina connector to create a azure cache for redis instance. We must pass subscription id, resource group name where cache instance should be created, cache instance name, location, properties of type CreateCacheProperty and optional parameters such as tags and array of zones as parameters to create a cache instance. It returns an RedisCacheInstance if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.
Azure Cache for Redis istances are created and take some time to get deployed and start running. We can check for state of cache instance by keep track of provisioningState which is one property of the cache instance created. Once state is running we can perform operations on the cache instance.

```ballerina
    CreateCacheProperty properties = 
    {
        "sku": {
            "name": "Basic",
            "family": "C",
            "capacity": 1
        },
        "enableNonSslPort": true,
        "redisConfiguration": {"maxmemory-policy": "allkeys-lru"},
        "minimumTlsVersion": minimumTlsVersion
    };

    RedisCacheInstance|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->createRedisCache("TestCache", "TestResourceGroup", "Southeast Asia", properties);
    if (response is RedisCacheInstance) {
        log:print("Azure cache instance created and deployment in progress");
        json state = response.properties.provisioningState;
        while (state != "Succeeded") {
            var getresponse = azureRedisManagementClient->getRedisCache("TestCache", "TestResourceGroup");
            if (getresponse is json) {
                state = getresponse.properties.provisioningState;
            }
        }
        log:print("Azure cache instance deployed and running");
    } else {
        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Get Azure Cache Instance

This part describes how to use the ballerina connector to get information regarding a specific azure cache for redis instance. We must pass subscription id, resource group name where cache instance resides and cache instance name as parameters to get all the data associated with a specific cache instance. It returns an RedisCacheInstance if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    RedisCacheInstance|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->getRedisCache(<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, "TestCache", "TestResourceGroup");
    if (response is RedisCacheInstance) {
        log:print("Azure cache instance fetched");
    } else {
        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Get all Azure Cache Instances in a resource group

This part describes how to use the ballerina connector to get information regarding a  azure cache for redis instances in a specific resource group. We must pass subscription id and resource group name where cache instances resides as parameters to get all the data associated with a cache instances. It returns an RedisCacheInstance[] if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    RedisCacheInstance|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->getRedisCache(<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, "TestCache", "TestResourceGroup");
    if (response is RedisCacheInstance[]) {
        log:print("Array of Azure cache instances fetched");
        foreach RedisCacheInstance redisInstance in response {
            log:print(redisInstance.toString());
        }
    } else {
        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Get all Azure Cache Instances in all resource group within a subscription

This part describes how to use the ballerina connector to get information regarding a azure cache for redis instances within a subscription. We must pass subscription id as parameter to get all the data associated with a cache instances in that subscription. It returns an RedisCacheInstance[] if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    RedisCacheInstance[]|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->listRedisCacheInstances(<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>);
    if (response is RedisCacheInstance[]) {
        foreach RedisCacheInstance redisInstance in response {
            log:print(redisInstance.toString());
        }
    } else {
        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Get Host Name

Host name is used in redis clients for making connection to an Azure Cache for Redis instance. It returns an string which will be used as host name(DNS name) in redis client if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    string|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->getHostName(<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, "TestCache", "TestResourceGroup");
    if (response is string) {
        log:print(response);
    } else {
        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Get SSL Port Number

        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Get Non SSL Port Number

Non SSL Port number is used in redis clients for making connection to an Azure Cache for Redis instance when only via SSL is disabled in instance. It returns an integer which will be used as non SSL port number (If NonSslPort is enabled only can connect through this port) in redis client if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    int|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->getNonSSLPortNumber(<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, "TestCache", "TestResourceGroup");

It returns an AccessKey if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    AccessKey|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->listKeys<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, ("TestCache", "TestResourceGroup");
    if (response is AccessKey) {
        json primaryKey = response.primaryKey;
        json secondaryKey = response.secondaryKey;
        log:print(primaryKey);
    } else {
        log:print(response.message());
    }
```

### Regenerate Access Keys

Those Primary and Secondary Keys can be regenerated by using this operation and opbained in a form of AccessKeys. It returns an AccessKey if  operation is successful or error if the operation is unsuccessful.

```ballerina
    AccessKey|error response = azureRedisManagementClient->regenerateKey<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>, ("TestCache", "TestResourceGroup", "Primary");
    if (response is AccessKey) {
        json primaryKey = response.primaryKey;
